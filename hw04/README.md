The purpose of this HW is to allow students to practice writing and testing functions, preparing and analyzing data, and using R packages.

```{r}
library(shiny)
# Run an app from a subdirectory in the repo
runGitHub("stat133-hws-fall17", "jessegao", subdir = "hw04/app")

## Comments and Reflections:
- This was not my first time writing tests so it was very intuitive
- However, ggvis was a nightmare to work with. It is a 8 on the scale of confusing.
- Conditional panels were easy.
- I like ggplot the most. base plot was alright and ggvis was like ggplot but bad. Syntactically.
- One of the gsi's helped me but I can't remember her name
- Took me around 15 hours to complete
- Much of the time spent on this project was on sorting out the data and figuring out what to do with ggvis.
