#Quadratic Equation
In algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form:

> $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$

where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.

#quadratic formula 

$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
